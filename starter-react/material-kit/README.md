### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 6.x

### Setting up for development
* clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:rosoftdeveloper/appseed.git`
* change directory to this project: `cd appseed/starter-react/material-kit`
* (Optionally) start the backend server [starter-express](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/starter-express/README.md) (default ip/port: `locahost:3000`)
* Default backend URL `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. This can be overwritten by updating the file: `src/views/LoginPage/LoginPage.jsx`

### Scripts
**Install Modules**
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm install -g serve # (optionally) 
```

**Run**
* **Linux/MacOs**: 
```npm run start```
* **Windows OS**: update the PORT, NODE_PATH in your environment, and after execute `start_win` target
```powershell
$env:PORT = "8080"
$env:NODE_PATH = "./src"
npm run start_win
```
* Visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. The `default port 8080` can be overwritten by updating the `package.json`, `scripts \ start` attribute.

**Production Build**
* **Linux/MacOs**: 
`npm run build` - build the app in `build` directory
* **Windows OS**: 
`npm run build_win` - build the app in `build` directory

**Test the production build**
`serve -s build` - and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. You should see this [app](https://react.appseed.us) running.
